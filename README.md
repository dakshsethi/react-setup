## About
Before starting with any React application we open up the terminal and fire up this command `npx create-react-app my-app` and what this command CRA (Create React App) does is, it gives us a boiler plate code for getting started with the react application. But CRA comes with extra dependencies which your project might need and furthing add to the file size.
For example, CRA by default comes with SASS loader but you will only be using CSS then there is no use for the SASS loader.
But by making your own custom boiler plate you can actually install only those plugins which you will be needing, thus saving size.

### Steps
#### 1. Creating the folder
```bash
mkdir react-setup
cd react-setup
```

#### 2. Setting up npm package
```bash
npm init -y
```
You will see a `package.json` file being generated in the `react-setup` directory.

#### 3. Installing React
Now after setting up with the `package.json` file, we will installing `react` and `react-dom`.
```bash
npm install react react-dom
```
This create a folder `node_modules/` and a file `package-lock.json`.

#### 4. Installing babel
```bash
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader
```

#### 5. Setting up Babel File
Create a file in the root directory by the name `.babelrc` and inside it paste the following code:
```json
{
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-react", "@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

#### 6. Installing Webpack
```bash
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
npm install html-webpack-plugin
```

#### 7. Connecting the webpack to babel
Create a file in the root directory by the name `webpack.config.js` and paste the following code inside it:
```js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.[hash].js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/index.html",
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    modules: [__dirname, "src", "node_modules"],
    extensions: ["*", ".js", ".jsx", ".tsx", ".ts"],
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: require.resolve("babel-loader"),
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.png|svg|jpg|gif$/,
        use: ["file-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
If we take a look at the above code, out entry file is an `index.js` in a `src/` folder. So first we create a folder by the name of `src` and create an `index.js` file.

#### 8. Creating Files
Create a folder named `src` and inside create the following files.
1. *index.js:*
```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'

ReactDom.render(<App />, document.querySelector("#root"));
```

2. *App.js:*
```js
import React from 'react'

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            Hello World!! ðŸš€ðŸš€
        </div>
    )
}

export default App
```

3. *index.html:*
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>React App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 9. Setting up Webpack
Open the `package-json` file and go-to *scripts*, replce the original script object with this:
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --hot --open --mode development",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js --mode production"
}
```

#### 10. Installing CSS & Image Plugins
```bash
npm install --dev style-loader css-loader file-loader
```

#### 11. Final
After completing all of the above steps and creating files, the folder structure will look like this:

Now you can make any React App and run `npm start` in the terminal and on your app will run on `localhost:8080`!! ðŸš€ðŸš€
